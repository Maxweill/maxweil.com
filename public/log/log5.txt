title: why is the 'm' in maxweil lowercase?
I would say there are three real reasons.

>I like how it looks.
>Someone I think is cool does the same thing with their name.
>I like to challenge convention, especially the conventions of language & writing.

However, if I were to wax poetic I would say something like: "Because I want minimize attention to 'the name' and instead direct attention towards 'the work' I produce."
